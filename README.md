# README

This is a rails exercise by Le Wagon in which I coded a simple version of an AirBnB website allowing users to perform CRUD operations on their Bed and Breakfasts.

I have also experimented with SASS and Bootstrap to try and make the styling of this website a little bit nicer to look at.

This app can be ran on `localhost`.
